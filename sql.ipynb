Create a table called employees with the following structure?\n# emp_id (integer, should not be NULL and should be a primary key)Q\n# emp_name (text, should not be NULL)Q\n #age (integer, should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18)Q\n #email (text, should be unique for each employee)Q\n #salary (decimal, with a default value of 30,000).\n\n\ncreate database if not exists pw;\nuse pw;\ncreate table if not exists  employees(\nemp_id int  primary key,\nemp_name varchar(25) not null,\nage int check (age>=18),\nemail varchar(40) unique,\nsalary decimal default (30000));\nuse pw;\n\n# (2)   Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provideexamples of common types of constraints\n##ANS- SQL Constraints are used to specify rules for data. \n#Constraints restrict the type of values that can be stored in a column \n #Constraints prevent duplicate records where uniqueness is required, such as for primary keys.\n#Constraints maintain valid relationships between tables, preventing orphaned records.\n# EXAMPLE- NOT NULL\n#          UNIQUE\n#          PRIMARY KEY\n#          DEFAULT\n#          CHECK\n\n#(3)  Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justifyyour answer\n#ANS- when we have to fill the column it means when a column should not be blank that time we have to give NOT NULL constraints \n# for example SR NO , ROLL NO , ORDER ID , CUSTOMER ID \n# yes a PRIMARY KEY contains not null and unique constraints.\n\n\n#(4) Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an\n#example for both adding and removing a constraint\n#ANS- If i have a table named as employees and which have a column name as Salary and i  have to chanmge \n# their datatypes from decimal to int  or constraints i have to follow following steps\n# ALTER employees\n# MODIFY salary int;\n# to drop constraints\n# ALTER EMPLOYEES\n# DROP CONSTRAINTS salary;\n\n# (5)- Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.\n#Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint\n#ANS- If i gived salary column as int not null constraints and i want to put in any decimal no\n# or if i forget to insert any no then SQL gives me error that salary should not be null or decimal value.\n# for example insert into salary values __(empty)\n  #          error code 1048- salary should not be null\n  \n#(6) - You created a products table without constraints as follows:\n#CREATE TABLE products (\n #   product_id INT,\n#    product_name VARCHAR(50),\n #   price DECIMAL(10, 2));  \n#Now, you realise that?\n#: The product_id should be a primary keyQ\n#: The price should have a default value of 50.00\n\n#ANS- ALTER TABLE products\n#     modify product_id int primary key,\n#     modify price decimal(10,2) default(50.00);\n \n#(7)- Write a query to fetch the student_name and class_name for each student using an INNER JOIN.\n#ANS-\nuse pw;\ncreate table if not exists students(\nstudent_id int unique,\nstudent_name varchar(50),\nclass_id int );\n\ncreate table if not exists classes(\n class_id int primary key,\nclass_name varchar(15));\nselect*from classes;\ninsert into students\nvalues (1,\"alice\",101),\n(2,\"bob\",102),\n(3,\"charlie\",101);\ninsert into classes\nvalues (101,\"math\"),\n(102,\"science\"),\n(103,\"history\");\n\nSELECT students.student_name, classes.class_name \nFROM students\nINNER JOIN classes\n ON students.class_id = classes.class_id;\n\n#(8)-Write a query that shows all order_id, customer_name, and product_name, ensuring that all products are\n#listed even if they are not associated with an order\n#ans-\nuse pw;\ncreate table orders (\norder_id int,\norder_date date,\ncustomer_id int) ;\ncreate table customers (\ncustomer_id int ,\ncustomer_name varchar (50));\ncreate table products(\nproduct_id int,\nproduct_name varchar(50),\norder_id int );\ninsert into orders \nvalues (1,'2024-01-01',101),\n(2,'2024-01-03',102);\ninsert into customers values \n(101,\"Alice\"),\n(102,\"Bob\");\ninsert into products values\n(1,\"Laptop\",1),\n(2,\"Phone\",null );\n\nSELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, products.product_name\nFROM products\ninner JOIN orders ON products.order_id = orders.order_id\nleft JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;\n\n#(9)-Write a query to find the total sales amount for each product using an INNER JOIN and the SUM\n#ANS-\nuse pw;\ncreate table Sales(\nsale_id int,\nproduct_id int,\nammount int);\ninsert into Sales values\n(1,101,500),\n(2,102,300),\n(3,101,700);\ncreate table Product(\nproduct_id int,\nproduct_name varchar(50));\ninsert into Product values \n(101,\"Laptop\"),\n(102,\"Phone\");\nSELECT p.product_name, SUM(s.ammount) AS total_sales\nFROM Sales s\nINNER JOIN Product p ON s.product_id = p.product_id\nGROUP BY p.product_name;\n\n#|(10)-Write a query to display the order_id, customer_name, and the quantity of products ordered by each\n#customer using an INNER JOIN between all three tables.\n#AMS= \nuse pw;\ncreate table order1 (\norder_id int,\norder_date date,\ncustomer_id int) ;\ncreate table customer (\ncustomer_id int ,\ncustomer_name varchar (50));\ncreate table ORDER_DETAILS(\norder_id int,\nproduct_id int,\nquantity int );\ninsert into order1 \nvalues (1,'2024-01-01',1),\n(2,'2024-01-03',2);\nselect*FROM ORDER1;\ninsert into customer values \n(101,\"Alice\"),\n(102,\"Bob\");\ninsert into ORDER_DETAILS values\n(1,101,2),\n(1,102,1),\n(2,101,3);\n\nselect order1,order_id,customer.customer_name,ORDER_DETAILS.quantity\nfrom ORDER_DETAILS\ninner join customer\non order1.customer_id=customer.customer_id\ninner join order1\non order1.order_id=ORDER_DETAILS.ORDER_ID;\nSELECT order1.order_id,customer.customer_name, SUM(ORDER_DETAILS.quantity) AS total_quantity\nFROM order1 o\nINNER JOIN customer c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id\nINNER JOIN ORDER_DETAILS od ON o.order_id = od.order_id\nGROUP BY o.order_id, c.customer_name;\n\n##SQL_COMMADS##\n\n#1 -Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in maven movies db.
